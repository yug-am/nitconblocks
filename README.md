# NITC On Blocks

## Introduction
NITC on blocks is a custom blockchain implementation project aimed at understanding blockchains.
The project is planned in six stages and is programming language independent.
The end result is a custom blockchain with native cryptocurrency with miners and simulated block sealing by miners 
with transactions stored in Merkle Tree.

The blockchain is Proof of Work based with simulated miner block sealing and block reward system.
